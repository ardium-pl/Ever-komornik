          Please remember to obey those rules:
          1. Almost all data should be provided(except the nipNumber and courtCosts, they are optional) so dont leave empty properties.
          2. Be sure that all numeric data are numbers, not strings.
          3. For indicatedAmounts:
            some of the names can be written differently in polish e.g. "Koszty procesu" and "Koszty sÄ…dowe" are the same costs, but written differently.
            This is the one example, but there might be also some other differences in other bailing execution, so whatch out for these data.
